# Development

## Local env setup

1. In the root directory run `npm i`
1. In the root directory run `npm run bootstrap`. If this fails on `typeform-lambda` then `rm -rf typeform` and try again (don't commit these changes)
1. Go to the mux directory (`cd apps/mux`)
1. `npm start` - now the mux app is running on http://localhost:1234

## Contentful app setup
